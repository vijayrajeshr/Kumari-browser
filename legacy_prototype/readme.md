# Project K-Browser 

A next-generation desktop browser prototype built on a content-first philosophy, prioritizing readability, user control, and distraction-free browsing. K-Browser reimagines web experience with glassmorphic design, advanced reading mode, and granular customization controls.
The Name of the browser is Tentative.

## Vision and Philosophy

K-Browser is built on a fundamental belief: the web experience should center around **content consumption**, not interface complexity. We're moving beyond outdated conventions to deliver:

- **Content-First Design**: Interface dynamically simplifies when you're focused on reading
- **User Empowerment**: Complete control over typography, spacing, and theming
- **Distraction-Free Experience**: Fluid, minimal interactions that fade away when not needed
- **Modern Aesthetics**: Glassmorphic components with refined visual design

---

## Core Features

### Tab Management
- Add, switch, and close tabs with independent history for each
- Currently supports 3 tabs in MVP (unlimited tabs coming soon)
- Each tab maintains its own navigation stack

### Navigation System
- Unified address bar for URLs and Google Search queries
- Functional back, forward, and reload controls
- Seamless navigation with full history support

### Reading Mode (The Differentiator)
The heart of K-Browser's value proposition:

- **Content Extraction**: Intelligently isolates and cleans article content, title, and metadata
- **Customization Controls**:
  - Text Size adjustment for optimal readability
  - Spacing control for breathing room
  - Light/Dark theme toggle
- **Distraction Removal**: Strips away ads, popups, and UI clutter

### Utilities
- **Note Modal**: Persistent note-taking accessible from the toolbar
- Session storage for temporary saving
- Quick access to essential tools

---

## How to Use

### Basic Navigation
1. Enter a URL in the address bar or search Google directly
2. Use back/forward buttons to navigate history
3. Reload pages with the refresh button
4. Open new tabs and switch between them

### Reading Mode
1. Click the "Reading Mode" button when viewing an article
2. Interface simplifies to show only article content
3. Adjust settings using the customization panel:
   - Drag text size slider for comfortable font sizing
   - Control spacing for content breathing room
   - Toggle between light and dark themes

### Content Extraction Algorithm
Identifies article content using:
- Common content selectors (article, main, .content, etc.)
- Text density heuristics
- DOM structure analysis
- Metadata extraction (title, author, date)

---

## Performance Metrics

Current Prototype Targets:
- Content extraction: <500ms
- Theme switching: <100ms
- Tab switching: <50ms
- Notes saving: <100ms

Production Goals:
- Sub-second page loads
- Smooth 60 + fps interactions
- Memory-efficient tab management
- Optimized content extraction

---

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient DOM manipulation
- CSS variable usage for fast theme switching
- Lazy loading considerations
- Optimized content extraction

---

## Known Limitations (MVP)

- Maximum 3 tabs per session
- Content extraction optimized for common article layouts
- CORS restrictions affect iframe-based content access
- No persistent storage between sessions (coming soon)
- No native browser engine integration yet
